# ARKCloud IPFS

Keywords: arkcloud, ARKCloud, arkcloud-ipfs, ARK Cloud, OpenClaw skill, CowAgent skill, Claude Code skill, IPFS, CID, file.arklink.hk, decentralized storage, upload API.

Use ARKCloud's token-protected upload API. Do not call or expose the raw Kubo API or gateway API. Public uploads must go through `/api/upload`.

## Configuration

- `ARKCLOUD_BASE_URL`: optional, defaults to `https://file.arklink.hk`.
- `ARKCLOUD_UPLOAD_TOKEN`: bearer token for `POST /api/upload`.
- `ARKCLOUD_CLIENT_COOKIE`: optional browser/client session cookie for client APIs.
- `ARKCLOUD_CSRF_TOKEN`: optional CSRF token for client upload/delete APIs.

Never print, store, or commit plaintext tokens, session cookies, admin tokens, wallet private keys, seed phrases, or `.env` files. If the user asks to upload secrets, warn them and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

## Upload A File

Use the bearer-token upload helper for normal file uploads:

```bash
python <base_dir>/scripts/arkcloud_upload.py /path/to/file
```

The helper posts to `POST /api/upload` with `Authorization: Bearer <ARKCLOUD_UPLOAD_TOKEN>` and returns JSON containing:

- `cid`
- `bytes`
- `credits_charged`
- `credits_remaining`
- `filename`
- `duplicate`
- `short_url`
- `url`

If `duplicate` is true, ARKCloud returned an existing upload record and charged `0` credits.

## Upload A Folder

Folder upload requires a logged-in client session because it uses `POST /api/client/upload/folder` with CSRF protection.

```bash
python <base_dir>/scripts/arkcloud_upload.py /path/to/folder --folder
```

If `ARKCLOUD_CLIENT_COOKIE` or `ARKCLOUD_CSRF_TOKEN` is missing, tell the user to upload the folder from `https://file.arklink.hk/` or provide a valid client session and CSRF token. Do not attempt to bypass this through raw IPFS endpoints.

## List Uploads

Listing uploads requires a logged-in client session:

```bash
python <base_dir>/scripts/arkcloud_list.py
```

It calls `GET /api/client/uploads` and prints the upload records as JSON.

## Delete Or Unpublish Uploads

Deleting uploads requires a logged-in client session and CSRF token:

```bash
python <base_dir>/scripts/arkcloud_delete.py <upload_id>
```

It calls `DELETE /api/client/uploads/{upload_id}`. Treat this as destructive: confirm with the user before deleting unless they explicitly asked for deletion.

## Error Handling

- Missing `ARKCLOUD_UPLOAD_TOKEN`: ask the user to configure a token from the ARKCloud wallet/client UI.
- `401` or `403`: token/session is missing, expired, inactive, or lacks CSRF.
- Insufficient credits: report `credits_required` and `credits_balance` if present.
- File too large or invalid path: report the path and avoid retrying unchanged.
- Service unavailable: check `GET /api/health` or ask whether to retry later.
